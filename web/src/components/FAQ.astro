    q: "How long does a website take?",
    a: "Most projects are completed within 1–2 weeks. If your content is ready and feedback is fast, we move even faster."
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need from me to start?",
    a: "Usually: your logo, brand colors (if you have them), a short description of your business, and any content you want included."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I request changes after launch?",
    a: "Absolutely. Each package includes revisions, and I offer optional update/support plans if you need long-term tweaks."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don’t like the first version?",
    a: "You’ll see a live homepage preview before development — so you can approve the style early and avoid surprises later."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer SEO or analytics?",
    a: "Yes. Every site includes basic SEO structure and Google Analytics setup — no extra charge."
